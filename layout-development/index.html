                    I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!
                </p>

                    Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.

                    Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze myself. That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the only explanation for the ease of our escape. Easy...you call that easy? Their tracking us! Not this ship, sister. At least the information in Artoo is still intact. What's so important? What's he carrying? The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet! It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money! You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you love, then that's what you'll receive!

                    They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it, Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think...
