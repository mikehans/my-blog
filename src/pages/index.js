    <h2>Hi I'm Mike</h2>
    <p>I'm a software developer with diverse experience across Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Office
        and general web development.</p>

    <p>I'm busy preparing for the step in my software journey, learning Power Platform and Microsoft 365.</p>

    <p>I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm trying to grow vegetables and am perpetually wondering what
    to do with the periodic glut in vegetables. My last go at radish pickles failed miserably, though I'm sure the
    compost loved it.</p>

    <p>I'm something of a gardener, woodworker and electronics hack. I'm trying to figure out how to make better
        use of my Raspberry Pi and am trying to build a moisture monitoring system for my garden with my Arduino gear.</p>
    
    <p>I blog about web development, Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft 365 though I'll likely touch on other topics of interest. </p>
    
    <p>This site is defintely a work in progress too. It's been rather a while since I designed a website from scratch, 
      having worked predominantly on established websites.
      This site is being built (presently) in Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. I have a lot to learn and it should be a lot of fun.
