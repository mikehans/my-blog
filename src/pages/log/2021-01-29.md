Well it's been a lot of work implementing a new design into my site. It's not perfect yet but it's well on track.

I had initially tried to bring in the design as a whole and then get it working. It was more trouble than it was worth and I bogged down. I cut out a new branch and implemented the design a page / component at a time. It was a far better approach.

So far, I've only evaluated the design on desktop - no responsive design as yet. It's worth it to me as this was taking a long time and I want to do other things with the site. Upgrading the design will be a progressive undertaking from now on. 

I'm not sure the Contact Us form works, so that's definitely the next step and I've opted to hide it for now. It's certainly the next cap off the rank for me. Ultimately, I want to undertake some project work using React and OIDC / OAuth 2.0. This is one of the mmain reasons why I chose to host my own site on Netlify.
