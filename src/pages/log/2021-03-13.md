I'm having some trouble getting Netlify Forms working. I followed the instructions to get a basic HTML form working. I can see the form registered in Netlify Forms and can see the POST request happening, however the form submission never appears in my Netlify console. 

As an interim solution, I've gotten a Google Form working. It doesn't look offensive at least but it doesn't really belong but it looks better than the Microsoft Forms solution I tried a while ago.
