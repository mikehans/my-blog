My initial attempt at implementing a new visual design bogged down - I don't think the approach was sound. I created a new branch for a new approach and an initial deployment has made to my test site. Things are looking better and I'm discovering benefits and limitations of the design. For now there will continue to be a lot of gaps as I pick and choose what to tackle. The designer used SVGs to create the diagonal lines separating the sections on the home page. It's an interesting idea, though I think I could use a single SVG programmatically modify it to suit. I have basically no experience with programming with SVGs so it will be an adventure, however I have bigger fish to fry. One bigger fish is that there's little use of Flexbox and Grid which I think could benefit the responsiveness of the design.
