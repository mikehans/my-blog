I'm currently re-doing the visual design for this site.

You can check my <a href="https://vd-redesign-0d416f.netlify.app/">latest test deployment here.</a>

I am currently adapting the visual design for React from <a href="https://html5up.net/solid-state">the Solid State design on HTML5 Up.</a>

You can view my <a href="https://github.com/mikehans/my-blog/tree/vd-redesign">vd-redesign branch on Github.</a>

You can also follow site development on my <a href="https://trello.com/b/LE4p3TtF/website" target="_blank">Trello board.</a>
