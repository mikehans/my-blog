## Hi I'm Mike and this is the About 2 page

I'm a software developer with extensive experience in web development, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Office, Microsoft 365.

I blog about web development, Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft 365 though I'll likely touch on other topics of interest. 

I live in Melbourne, Australia with family. I'm something of a gardener, woodworker and electronics hack.
I try to grow vegetables and am periodically wonder what
to do with a glut in some vegetable or another. My last go at radish pickles failed miserably, though I'm sure the
compost loved it.

I'm trying to figure out how to make better use of my Raspberry Pi and am trying to build a moisture monitoring 
system for my garden with my Arduino gear.

This site is defintely a work in progress too. It's somewhat bare-bones right now. 
It's been rather a while since I designed a website from scratch, having worked predominantly on established websites.
This site is being built (presently) in Gatsby and hosted on Netlify. I have a lot to learn and it should be a lot of fun.
