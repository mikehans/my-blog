# Woodcarving with Peppercorn Wood
I've been woodcarving on and off for several months now. It's a very affordable activity - just prune off a small branch off a tree and off you go. I was very fortunate to be given a couple of very nice knives over the past several years and it's great to be using them and caring for them properly. 

what's good about woodcarving?
- cheap
    - hatchet, knife, hook knife, saw, sharpening equipment
    - that's about it...
- making use of "scraps" that other woodworkers would discard (eg. branches of all sizes)
- availability of timber
    - it's in my backyard (verbena, peppercorn, silver birch)
    - it blows down in a storm (a branch from a tree nearby) or the council or a neighbour cuts it down and puts it on the street
    - leads to great diversity in the timber available
        - in my area there's the possibility of: eucalypts, crepe myrtle, melaluca, elm, jacaranda
        - the timber is more readily brought home and broken down than logs I want for joinery

challenges
- proportion (design sense)
    - but that's OK, it's cheap to make mistakes
- making good cuts, leaving a nice smooth carved surface with only the facets I want left
- accuracy in shaping
    - trying to get 2 sides (say of a spoon handle) look similar
    - have been practicing carving a disc
    - making a nice bevel

working with peppercorn
- when wet it has a waxy carved surface that's very nice to touch
- very white
- little to no visible grain
- lots of small knots leading to
    - carving challenges
    - twisting as the timber dries
- as it dries it seems to leave ridges that follow the fibre structure of the timber
