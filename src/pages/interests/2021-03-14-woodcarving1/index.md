# Woodcarving with Peppercorn Wood
I've been woodcarving on and off for several months now. It's a very affordable activity - just prune off a small branch off a tree and off you go. I was very fortunate to be given a couple of very nice knives over the past several years and it's great to be using them and caring for them properly - well learning to care for them. 

## What's good about woodcarving?
### Cheap!
Well, it's cheap! You need a hatchet, knife, hook knife, saw and sharpening equipment (stone and oil for me) and that's about it. My hatchet is more or less junk but it'll do for now. I'm experimenting with different sharpening methods to try to improve it. I've also seen people re-shaping the handle on a hatchet. Maybe I'll give it a go in future.

### People throw away timber!
You also get to make use of the scraps of timber that other woodworkers would overlook. I can pick up branches of all sizes. This being Australia, there's a lot of stuff that isn't going to carve well. Eucalypts can be pretty hard on tools though the results can be well worth it. I also picked up a piece of (what I think is) melaleuca recently. I don't know what kind - it was cut up on the street; a houselholder was hoping someone would take it for firewood. Some test cuts seem to show that it may not be all that interesting but it may make a decent mallet head. I'm not even entirely sure how hard this stuff is but I know one way of finding out. 

### It's in my backyard too!
In my yard I have verbena, peppercorn and silver birch that need pruning. I carved my first spoons with some verbena and have been using some peppercorn recently.

## Challenges
### Design sense
Oh boy. My sense of proportion is... well, let's say average. Perhaps I really should have learnt more in high school art class. Perhaps this is "catch up". 

### Making good cuts
Leaving a nice smooth carved surface is kind of a goal. Supposedly the knife leaves (or it can leave) a nicer surface than sandpaper can leave. This one is going to come down to knife control I think. I'm consistently leaving facets that I don't want on my surfaces and am struggling to control the knife sufficiently to take a continuous shaving the lenth of my work. Instead I'm taking many small shavings. With practise I'll get there. This goes hand in hand with...

### Accuracy in shaping
Trying to get two sides of (say) a spoon handle to look similar takes some work and I'm not there yet. I've had a few tries at making a round disc that could end up as something like a button. My latest tries went OK too. They were more or less round and the bevelled edge was generally reasonable. Perhaps improving my layout might help and I'm learning how to better control my knife to make better cuts.

## Trials with peppercorn
I'm using peppercorn because it's in my backyard and has been in need of pruning. When wet, it has a waxy carved surface that's quite nice to touch. Of course this doesn't last and it dries quite white with little grain. It's not a very interesting timber. However, there are lots of small knots, leading to carving challenges and creating some nasty twist as the carved surface dries. I also regularly find that it develops some pretty ugly grooves along some of the fibres as it dries too. My best two attempts at carving a spatula have left me with horribly twisted products after they have dried. An approach I'm going to try is to carve a product to about 80% complete, let it dry then carve it again. Hopefully that will deal with the issues that wreck a half decent piece.
