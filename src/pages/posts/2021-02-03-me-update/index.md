## Where have I been and what have I been doing?
OK, so why the layoff over Christmas and through January? I started this site while I was out of work late last year - a COVID affected circumstance. Frankly, I was also pretty burnt out as well. I was in a fortunate position to be able to afford to take some time off. It gave me a chance to consider my career and what I wanted to do.

### So what has happened recently?
So, the site re-design was a big job and took up a lot of my extra time. Good grief. I've covered off on it briefly on the [29 Jan 2021 entry in my Site Development log](/site-development), so I won't re-hash it here. So far, I have an initial if flawed implementation of the VD and it feels good to have broken the back of it. 

The other thing that happened was that I picked up a new job. I feel really good about it, it's a full stack job and I'm able to contribute a lot to the software being developed. Most importantly, I feel ready to work. I'm interested in writing software again and have the energy for it. It's quite a change from how I felt a year ago. That's a very big win. To succeed here, I need to focus on .NET, ReactJS & Postgresql. Linux won't hurt either as my dev stack is essentially Linux based. As the job is in the cybersecurity industry, there could be some good opportunities to learn as much as possible about building secure software as well. This job is a bit of a pivot from Microsoft 365 and Power Platform but it's a welcome one.
